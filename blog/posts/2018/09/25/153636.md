It's time for more work.

First thing -- hook up the event from GitHub to the cache in githubpub.js.

Now with this change, the page should not update when I refresh it, because the cache deleting code isn't running yet. Let's see if that works as it should. (Seems to work as advertised.)

Now with the new code running... 123456

It was tricky -- going from the info GitHub provides to the location in my cache, but it appears to be working. If you can see this when I update, without having to reboot the server, that means it worked.
