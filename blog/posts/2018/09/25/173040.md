[John Oliver](http://scripting.com/2018/09/25.html#a151130) is right about Facebook. And the thing is we knew it would be, because we came from there. There was always a bunch of bullshit on mail lists, that's why we found new ways to collaborate, in the primeval days of the web.

We built Web 2.0 on those ideas, but then SV decided to scale it and centralize it, and people liked it, because they believed it was a human experience. Why not? It _seemed_ like one.

The human mind has an incredible ability to abstract. Once convinced it's a real conversation, it doesn't give that idea up easily. (Understatement.)

That's why Facebook has become such a disaster.

And why Jack is still wondering why conversation doesn't happen on Twitter.

We've incorrectly abstracted this as a human experience. It is not. Evolution did not prepare us for this. Yet here we are.
