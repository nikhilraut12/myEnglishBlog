Okay I'm putting the server(s) aside for a bit.

The main question there is whether there should be one server or two.

For now there are two, and the link between them is in the settings in the editor. Obviously this is not going to work for casual users, but lets bootstrap this one. ;-)

#### Doing the eye icon

Right now the eye icon takes you to the GitHub page. That should be under a different icon, one for GitHub. The eye icon should take you to the rendering.

I really had to hack it up, because information about the structure of the repo is scattered all over the place. A cleanup is needed, badly.
