Hopefully the major factoring is done, now it's time to work on cleanup.

Here's a list...

Move [englishblog1.scripting.com](http://englishblog1.scripting.com)Â to point to rockaway.scripting.com. Tell pagepark to route it to english server (port 1402).

Okay mapping is done. The question is this -- how does the server tell us how to access a page over the web?

The answer -- it returns a domain value in the jstruct representing a post. That's used in computing the URL that is opened when you click the Eye icon.
