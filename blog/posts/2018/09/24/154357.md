I took a day off, mostly.

I have githubpub working with the new format for posts.

The templates come from the repo.

I want to hook it up to webhooks on GitHub and use that to manage the cache. And pull all that down into davegithub so it's nicely reusable. That would be a nice project for today. Let's see how far we can get.
