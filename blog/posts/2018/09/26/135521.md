Annoyance -- we get messages from GitHub where the path to the object being modified is undefined. Great. So I added some debugging code that would write out the JSON message if path is undefined, but we're not getting it. I think what I have to do is write out all packets to unique files, so I can look at all of them.

Okay, I'm writing out all the packets. There's a new setting, [config.flAllowAccessFromAnywhere](http://config.xxx) that controls this.

However I think I can only get the undefined value to show up when I'm creating a new post? That turns out to be correct.  When you create a new post, it sends a message with nothing in the modified array, but there is an array called added that has the path to the newly created object.
