Annoyance -- we get messages from GitHub where the path to the object being modified is undefined. Great. So I added some debugging code that would write out the JSON message if path is undefined, but we're not getting it. I think what I have to do is write out all packets to unique files, so I can look at all of them.

Okay, I'm writing out all the packets. There's a new setting, config.flDebugMessagesFromGitHub that controls this.

However I think I can only get the undefined value to show up when I'm creating a new post? That turns out to be correct.  When you create a new post, it sends a message with nothing in the modified array, but there is an array called added that has the path to the newly created object.

#### My cache code was wrong

Too much abstraction. There is a concept of a domain that githubpub implements. It's good. It means you can map domains to different repos, or even parts of repos.

But the cache shouldn't use this concept. It should strictly be username, repository, path.

So I did the conversion.

Wish me luck.

There was a mistake, debugged locally, found it, fixed it, and we're back on the air.
