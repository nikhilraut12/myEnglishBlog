Here's a very short post to be used in a couple of examples for the API for githubpub.

And the docs are [here](https://github.com/scripting/githubpub/blob/master/docs/api.md).

So far we only document the reading operations.

I want to do some work on making it easy to get an accessToken, before trying to do the writing ops.
