Key point, we use the default template in the githubpub repo, unless the user overrides it by creating a template/template.txt file in the repo that holds the blog.

I also [wrote docs](https://github.com/scripting/githubpub/blob/master/docs/templates.md) for how templates work. Now we've got a framework for describing it and getting feedback.

Edited in hello world editor.
