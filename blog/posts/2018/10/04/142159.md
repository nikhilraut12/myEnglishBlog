Trump pretended he didn't know what the KKK is when David Duke endorsed him. He led cheers of "Lock her up" referring to Hillary Clinton. He praised Nazis who marched in Charlottesville and ran down a crowd, killing a woman. And so much more. This is a depraved narcissistic madman. A very dangerous person. So you're surprised he dissed Dr Ford? It was 100% predictable.
