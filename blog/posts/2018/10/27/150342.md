In theory, when we log on via the Minimal editor now, it should redirect back to the Minimal editor not English.

It works. Feels very good. There's a new clients struct in config.json. Three bits of info for each client:

1. GitHub client ID.

2. GitHub client secret.

3. The URL of the editor app.

Perfect!
