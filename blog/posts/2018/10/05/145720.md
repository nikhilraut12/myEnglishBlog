Going to do it slowly and incrementally, testing as we go.

Until english server disappears. ;-)

More overhauling happening.

Still more...

Now I should be able to log on through GHP.

Now the Oauth code is in GHP..

Yeah. I like it when I make a mistake because then I know I'm using the new code for sure. And then I fix it and it works again. It's nice to get a little resistance.
