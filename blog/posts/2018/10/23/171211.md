Here goes. This is the acid test.

James Taylor is singing the National Anthem tonight at Fenway Park to open the World Series. He sings it the best. It's an awkward song, that's hard to sing. Can be cringe-worthy. But it's perfect for James Taylor. I'll make you happy, and probably make you cry if you have a heart and love our country. 

Actually you know this *editor* is pretty nice. Bare bones and all. But cool.
