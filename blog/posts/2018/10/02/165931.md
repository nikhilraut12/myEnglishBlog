Working on style sheet. Make it look like a rendered blog post.

Smaller text, using Ubuntu and Oswald. Same font sizes as Scripting News.

Also when creating a new post the Description field is empty but the placeholder doesn't show.

Now font size looks very nice.

Getting better all the time...

#### Here's a headline

Oh say can you see...

Way better...

Now I need a break! :-)
