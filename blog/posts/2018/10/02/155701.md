Now the list of posts is very short. I wonder if I should restore it or take it as an omen. It's probably not a bug, I was just fucking with the code in that area of the app.

I'm going to leave the list alone for now. This is all crap anyway. If it's gone it's gone. WTF.

Next up -- change the way englishhome refers to a website. Use the domain name from config.json on the server.
