hello//...yyy

do you know the way to go home?

you know the changes they made to chrome make it easy to switch to another browser. the things they changed are the things that make switching uncomfortable.

That's fucking amazing.

new computer coming tomorrow!

another thing to add to the todo list -- websockets connection with pages we're serving. we send updated content as it becomes available.
