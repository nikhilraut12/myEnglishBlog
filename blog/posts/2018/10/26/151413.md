There was a little unexpected behavior.

It doesn't update the post to change urlHtml to urlPublic when the post is saved.

But new posts have urlPublic. For example, [this](https://github.com/scripting/myEnglishBlog/blob/master/blog/posts/2018/10/26/151413.md) is such a post.

This is a test.

I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside.

Lock him up!
