I've become email friends with Dave Gandy, the founder of Font Awesome. I can't sing the praises of that product high enough. It's a life saver, if it didn't exist, I'd still be stealing graphics and they'd suck as icons. FA takes care of an important part of the UI of the web.

Second disclaimer, I juggle so many external technologies I don't have the bandwidth to dive into any of them too deeply, so when I think I uncover a problem, very often I am not, it's just a lack of info, misunderstanding, or the fact that I exist in a perpetual state of developer fog.
