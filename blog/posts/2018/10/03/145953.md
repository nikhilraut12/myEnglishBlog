I've become email friends with [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy), the founder of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I can't sing the praises of that product high enough. It's a life saver, if it didn't exist, I'd still be stealing graphics and they'd suck as icons. FA takes care of an important part of the UI of the web.

now let's see if something changes! adfasdfasdfasdf

There's a better way to enter a numbered list. Type the elements of the list, then select them and do the numbering from the palette.

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three
4.  Four

Now you go on as you were doing previously.

Second disclaimer, I juggle so many external technologies I don't have the bandwidth to dive into any of them too **deeply**, so when I think I uncover a problem, very often I am not, it's just a lack of info, misunderstanding, or the fact that I exist in a perpetual state of developer fog.

#### Here's a _bulleted_ list:

*   Oregon.

*   Minneapolis.

*   Pittsburgh.

*   Madison

#### Here's a _numbered_ list:

1.  hello
2.  goodbye

This is the text that appears after the list.
