Today is a day for putting a new face on.

We now have a rudimentary styled title, description, body editor that saves to GitHub.

Now the body editor is wider. As is the pagebody.

So now are we ready to put this project down for a bit?

Not quite. There's still the question of URL formation. :-)

Probably also want to do something about adding a header graphic to a post.

And make the template more reflect the layout of the editing page, with a big font.
