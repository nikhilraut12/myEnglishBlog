But I'm expecting to take a trip to California over the weekend and into next week, so I will lose momentum pretty quickly.

First thing I'm going to do is to make some tweaks to how RSS feed is built.

OK. Have a nice day. It's good. The changes meant that the committer and message go with the building of the RSS feed. Previously I used made-up info because it wasn't part of the call to build the feed.

I also added the channel-level &lt;title> element to the feed so it now validates.
