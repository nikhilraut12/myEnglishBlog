And this time, surprisingly, it's built on the server, not in the client.

I like the idea of it being out of the way. Makes it possible for people to do custom editors without having to worry about doing the RSS feed.

Seemed like a good division of labor.

I love the the committer on the changes is Bull Mancuso.
